There are 2 Jupyter Notebooks that run Python code.

•	PRK_BreastCancer_Tensorflow.ipynb

•	PRK_BreastCancer_Scikit_Learn.ipynb 

To run these Notebooks the Python environment should have the Numpy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn and Pandas packages installed.
The Notebooks also need the /data/breastcancer.csv data file. The default folder for it is the /data location, which is 1 folder down from the root folder where the Notebook files reside.
